abstract = {We construct a lattice Boltzmann model of a single-layer, "reduced gravity" ocean in a square basin, with shallow water or planetary geostrophic dynamics, and boundary conditions of no slip or no stress. When the volume of the moving upper layer is sufficiently small, the motionless lower layer outcrops over a broad area of the northern wind gyre, and the pattern of separated and isolated western boundary currents agrees with the theory of Veronis (1973). Because planetary geostrophic dynamics omit inertia, lattice Boltzmann solutions of the planetary geostrophic equations do not require a lattice with the high degree of symmetry needed to correctly represent the Reynolds stress. This property gives planetary geostrophic dynamics a significant computational advantage over the primitive equations, especially in three dimensions.},

	abstract = {Dewetting is the hydrodynamic process where a uniform layer of liquid destabilizes and decays into distinct patterns of stationary droplets by virtue of interfacial and intermolecular energies. These patterns can now be predicted theoretically, and their evolution can be followed numerically in striking similarity to experimental results. The droplet arrays observed during the quasistatic evolution are generated by two distinct types of instabilities: droplet shedding of moving liquid rims and satellite droplet pinch-off during the decay of stationary ridges. The mechanism causing the emergence of different droplet patterns is the dissipation at the liquid{\textendash}solid interface modeled by an effective Navier slip.Thin polymer films on hydrophobic substrates are susceptible to rupture and hole formation. This, in turn, initiates a complex dewetting process, which ultimately leads to characteristic droplet patterns. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the type of droplet pattern depends on the specific interfacial condition between the polymer and the substrate. Predicting the morphological evolution over long timescales and on the different length scales involved is a major computational challenge. In this study, a highly adaptive numerical scheme is presented, which allows for following the dewetting process deep into the nonlinear regime of the model equations and captures the complex dynamics, including the shedding of droplets. In addition, our numerical results predict the previously unknown shedding of satellite droplets during the destabilization of liquid ridges that form during the late stages of the dewetting process. While the formation of satellite droplets is well known in the context of elongating fluid filaments and jets, we show here that, for dewetting liquid ridges, this property can be dramatically altered by the interfacial condition between polymer and substrate, namely slip. This work shows how dissipative processes can be used to systematically tune the formation of patterns.},
